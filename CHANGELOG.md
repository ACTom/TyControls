# Changelog

All notable changes to **ty-controls** are documented in this file. The project uses
3-part semantic versions (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`). Every control is fully custom-drawn via
BGRABitmap and themed by lightweight `.tycss` text themes — pixel-identical on Windows,
Linux and macOS.

## [2.1.0] — 2026-06-30

A large feature release. The headline is **TTyTreeView**, a full VirtualTreeView-class virtual
tree, joined by five more new controls, native window resize and window effects for **TTyForm**,
and keyboard mnemonics across the whole library.

### Added — New controls

- **TTyTreeView** — a virtual, data-on-demand tree that scales to millions of nodes:
  - Lazy 3-stage node initialization; an incremental height/position cache with fast hit-testing.
  - Multi-column with a draggable header — column **resize**, **reorder**, **auto-size / spring**.
  - **Sorting** — `OnCompareNodes`, click-to-sort header with a direction glyph, lazy-aware merge sort.
  - **Checkboxes** with tri-state + automatic tri-state propagation, and **radio-button** nodes.
  - **Multi-selection** (Ctrl / Shift / Ctrl+A) and **full-row** select.
  - **Variable per-node row height** (`OnMeasureItem`).
  - **Incremental type-to-find** search.
  - **Per-cell owner-draw** (`OnDrawNode` / `OnAfterCellPaint`).
  - **Inline cell editing** (F2 / double-click; Enter commits, Esc cancels; `OnEditing` / `OnNewText`).
  - **Intra-tree node drag-drop** — reorder or reparent, accent drop-mark, circular-reparent guard.
- **TTySplitter** — drag to resize a neighbouring control.
- **TTyStatusBar** — paneled status bar.
- **TTyToolBar** — toolbar with separators.
- **TTyDateTimePicker** — segmented date/time editing with a drop-down calendar and a time spinner.
- **TTyCalendar** — calendar with day → month → year drill-down.

### Added — TTyForm

- Native window **resize** (Windows custom frame: `WS_THICKFRAME` + `WM_NCCALCSIZE` /
  `WM_NCHITTEST`) with a published **`Resizable`** property; maximize fills the monitor work area;
  title-bar drag and top-edge resize.
- OS **rounded corners + native drop shadow** (Windows 11 DWM / macOS), on by default, opt-out via CSS.

### Added — Interaction, theming, i18n

- **Mnemonics** — `&`-accelerators with Alt-underline display and Alt+letter activation across
  menus, buttons, check boxes, radio buttons, group boxes, labels and tabs.
- **TTyNativeStyler** — harmonizes native / third-party LCL controls with the active theme.
- **TTyComboBox** — shared themed drop-down popup.
- **Internationalization** — `resourcestring`s plus English and Simplified-Chinese `.po` catalogs
  for theme diagnostics, design-time strings and the demo (with a runtime language switcher).

### Fixed

- **TreeView** — node icons not painting (the ImageList draw was erased by the BGRA composite and
  is now drawn after it; the real root cause was `MainColumn` being assigned before columns
  existed); HiDPI vertical axis (scroll / hit-test / scroll-into-view); embedded scrollbars for
  huge ranges (minimum thumb size, 64-bit position mapping, constructor-time creation); expand
  chevron size; horizontal scrolling; a managed node-data leak on teardown; multi-select count
  integrity on delete / clear.
- **TTyForm** — maximize edge slipping under the taskbar; double-click-maximize "growing in place";
  top-edge resize; a too-thick top frame.
- **Theming** — crash when a dual-mode theme is loaded without a mode; `TTyNativeStyler` text colour
  on dark themes.
- **TTyEdit** — the caret height now tracks the font line-height (it was tied to the box height,
  which gave a stunted caret in tight hosts such as the tree's inline editor).
- **TTyMemo** — text-measurement performance (a per-line width cache).

### Platform

- **macOS** — compile + run fixes (a process unit for OS theme detection, `CGFloat`, multi-monitor
  startup positioning).
- **IME** support on custom-drawn edits (Qt6 / GTK2).

### Notes

- The version string is now **3-part** (`2.1.0`) and is shown by every component's read-only
  `About` property.
- Native window resize is **Windows-only** in this release; GTK / Qt / Cocoa fall back to a manual
  resize gutter (a native handoff is planned).

## [2.0.0] — 2026-06-20

Initial 2.x baseline: the custom-drawn control set on the `.tycss` v2 theme engine (merge-then-
resolve, tiered tokens, dual `@mode`, OS light/dark + accent follow, hot-reload + lint), a 12-theme
built-in pack, per-component `About` metadata, and the release tooling.
